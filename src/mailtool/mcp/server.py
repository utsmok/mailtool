"""Mailtool MCP Server

This module provides the main FastMCP server instance for Outlook automation.
It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using the official MCP Python SDK v2
with the FastMCP framework.

The server provides 25 tools and 7 resources for Outlook email, calendar, and task management.
All tools return structured Pydantic models for type safety and LLM understanding.
